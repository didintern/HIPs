This is the suggested template for new HIPs.

Note that an HIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your HIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `hip-<hip_number>.md`.

## Simple Summary
"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the HIP. Imagine an email subject line, GitHub PR title, or forum post title.

## Abstract
A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed. This should be a very terse and human-readable version of the specification section. Someone should be able to read only the abstract to get the gist of what this specification does.

## Motivation
The motivation section should describe the "why" of this HIP. What problem does it solve? Why should someone want to implement this standard? What benefit does it provide to the Hypersign ecosystem?

## Specification
(Optional) The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Hypersign platforms.

## Rationale
The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages.

## Backwards Compatibility
(Optional) All HIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The HIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. HIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

## Reference Implementation
(Optional) 
- An optional section that contains a reference/example implementation that people can use to assist in understanding or implementing this specification.
- Urls or any blogs/article/research papers etc from where the author took the motivation for this HIP can also be put here in bullets.
