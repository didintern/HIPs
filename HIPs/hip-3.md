## Simple Summary
A user should be able to store their crypto material on distributed cloud based system

## Abstract
Key management is huge problem for end users in SSI infra since the whole system fails if user is unable to recover his crypto materials. 


## Rationale

We can not expect humans to be perfect. Quoting from a blog on internet.

> "It’s unwise to create an infrastructure where ownership of possessions depends solely on people’s memory. Raise your hand if you have NEVER used the “I forgot my password” function. Raise your hand if you have NEVER lost a car key or a house key or needed help to access a locked space. Not a lot of hands, right?"

## Implementation idea

The idea is to come up with distribtued backup and restore key management where one party (key manager) should not control keys of all identities.
